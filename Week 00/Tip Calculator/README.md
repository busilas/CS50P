# Tip Calculator

This Python program is an implementation to [CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python Week 0 - Tip Calculator Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/tip/), named `tip.py`, calculates the tip amount for a restaurant meal based on the meal cost and the desired tip percentage. The program includes functions `dollars_to_float` and `percent_to_float` to convert input strings to corresponding float values for dollars and percentages.

## Program Code

```python
# tip.py

def main():
    dollars = dollars_to_float(input("How much was the meal? "))
    percent = percent_to_float(input("What percentage would you like to tip? "))
    tip = dollars * percent
    print(f"Leave ${tip:.2f}")

def dollars_to_float(d):
    return float(d[1:])

def percent_to_float(p):
    return float(p[:-1]) / 100

main()
```

## How to Test

1. Run the program as mentioned in the "How to Run the Program" section.
2. Enter various meal costs in the format $##.## and desired tip percentages in the format ##%.
3. The program should output the calculated tip amount based on the provided inputs.

## Sample Test Cases

1. **How much was the meal?** $50.00
   **What percentage would you like to tip?** 15%
   **Leave** $7.50

2. **How much was the meal?** $100.00
   **What percentage would you like to tip?** 18%
   **Leave** $18.00

3. **How much was the meal?** $15.00
   **What percentage would you like to tip?** 25%
   **Leave** $3.75
